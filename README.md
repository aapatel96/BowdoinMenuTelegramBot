# BowdoinMenuTelegramBot

At some point in late-2016 I lost my phone and replaced it with a pretty awful Gionee P5. The phone was so bad that I couldn't install many apps and simple websites, like my college's cafeteria website, would lag. The only apps which worked relatively well on my phone were the messaging apps (like Telegram, WhatsApp etc). To solve my problem of not being able to access the daily lunch menu, I created a telegram bot which scrapes the menu data and sends it to users as a simple text message.

Here's what it looks like in action:

*NOTE:* this is not working rn because bowdoin has changed its cafeteria menu urls. Also I've graduated and I have no intention of going back to Bowdoin any time soon so I don't see any point in fixing it right now.
